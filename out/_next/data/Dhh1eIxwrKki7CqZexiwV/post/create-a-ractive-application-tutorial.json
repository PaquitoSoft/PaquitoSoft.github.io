And every time I needed to learn how to implement something, it was pretty straightforward to find out.</p>\n<p>We finally didn't use <em>Ractive.JS</em> in our project as we found some issues regarding server-side <em>html</em> rendering we couldn't solve (<a href=\"https://github.com/ractivejs/ractive/issues/1648\">more  info</a>) and I can tell you it was a hard decision to drop it.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm a big fan of this library and I'm eager to use it in my side projects (couldn't begin any new one this year so far).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, I spend the little spare time I have these days following the great tutorials you can find in <a href=\"https://www.egghead.io\">egghead.io</a>. Specially, I enjoyed the <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/react/\">ReactJS</a> ones.\nThis library has a lot of popularity nowadays and I wanted to know why.\nFrom my point of view, <em>ReacjJS</em> is also a great library and if you combine it with the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html\">Flux</a> architecture, it's also a powerful tool for you to build complex systems.\nBut, the more I know about <em>ReactJS</em> the more I wonder why <em>Ractive.JS</em> is not as popular. Of course the latter (built by the bright people at <em>The Guardian</em>) does not have <em>Facebook</em> behind, but from the developer perspective, I think it's at as good as the other one.</p>\n<p>So, when I finished the great <a href=\"https://github.com/tylermcginnis/\">Tyler McGinnis</a> tutorial on <a href=\"https://egghead.io/series/build-your-first-react-js-application\">how to build an app with <em>ReactJS</em></a>, I was convinced to do the same with <strong>Ractive.JS</strong>.</p>\n<h2>Tutorial introduction</h2>\n<p>The goal of this tutorial is to introuduce you to the world of <em>Ractive.JS</em>. Also, as I've been reading a lot about <em>ES2015</em> (formerly <em>ES6</em>), I will be using the next version of <em>Javascript</em> thanks to another brilliant tool: the <a href=\"https://babeljs.io/\">Babel</a> transpiler.\nThe last tools I will be using is <a href=\"http://webpack.github.io/\">webpack</a> to build all of our front-end assets and <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a> for dependency management.\nI will also be using a couple of extra libraries apart from <em>React.JS</em> I will explain when the time comes.</p>\n<p>You can find the final code for this tutorial at <a href=\"https://github.com/PaquitoSoft/notetaker-ractive\">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<h2>Summary</h2>\n<p>These are the links for the different steps of the tutorial:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/post/ractive-js-tutorial-setting-up-your-environment\">Setting up your environmet</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/post/ractive-js-tutorial-creating-the-barebones\">Creating the barebones</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/post/ractive-js-tutorial-routing\">Routing</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/post/ractive-js-tutorial-loading-user-info\">Loading user info (GitHub)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/post/ractive-js-tutorial-managing-users-notes\">Managing user's notes (Firebase)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/post/ractive-js-tutorial-the-final-touch\">The final touch</a></li>\n</ol>\n"},"_superjson":{"values":{"post.creationDate":["Date"]}}},"__N_SSG":true}
